"Earache is one of the most common symptom for a patient to visit ENT doctor. It poses difficulty to diagnose the root cause when ENT examination is normal and still the pain persists, hence many a times patients are presumed to have psychosomatic element. While evaluation of earache dental status is often overlooked. 93 such patients of persistent earache with normal ENT examination were evaluated. In 70 of these patients the earache was attributed to either absent, unerupted or obliquely positioned upper or lower last molars which was confirmed by Orthopantomogram.",PubMedAbstracts
"Introduction?An earache (otalgia or ear pain) is pain in one or both ears that may last a short or long time. Earache is prevalent in the population with temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJDs), but there is a dearth of epidemiologic studies regarding the association between TMJD and ear pain and ear fullness in older people. Objective?To assess the presence of earache and ear fullness in elderly patients with TMJD. Methods?A cross-sectional study was conducted in independently living, elderly individuals. TMJD was assessed by dental evaluation and earache was verified by medical history. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test and relative risk. Results?Of the 197 subjects evaluated in this part of the study, 22 had earache, and 35 was verified by ear fullness. Of the 22 subjects with earache, none had conductive or mixed hearing loss in the ears tested. There was a significant association (p?=?0.036) between the TMJD and earache (odds ratio?=?2.3), but there was no significant association between the TMJD and ear fullness. Conclusion?These results highlight the importance of identifying risk factors for earache that can be modified through specific interventions, which is essential in the prevention of future episodes, as well as managing the process of treatment of elderly patients in general",PubMedAbstracts
"Otalgia is a common symptom in general practice and represents the sensation of pain in the ear. In four patients, three women aged 63, 57 and 37 years, and a man aged 64 years, ear pain was found to be caused by laryngeal carcinoma (two patients), oropharyngeal carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (in a Turkish patient). Referred otalgia is an earache that is caused by a nonotologic source. In many cases it is difficult to identify the underlaying disease of referred otalgia. It may be the first symptom of a head-and-neck carcinoma. In case of otalgia with normal otologic findings, the differential diagnostic process must be specifically directed to the common sensory innervation of the ear and the head-and-neck structures. By carefully taking the patient's history with special attention to epidemiological factors such as smoking and drinking habits, racial traits, a positive family history of head-and-neck neoplasms and accompanying complaints and by performing repeated ENT examination including advanced imaging techniques, long delay in diagnosing head-and-neck cancer can be prevented.",PubMedAbstracts
"OBJECTIVE:

To examine whether watchful waiting was an appropriate strategy for patients with earache, when there was no clear indication to prescribe antibiotics at the first visit.
DESIGN:

Case series of consecutive patients with unilateral earache.
SETTING:

Rural family practice clinic and walk-in centre.
PARTICIPANTS:

One hundred patients with unilateral earache.
INTERVENTIONS:

Patients who clearly needed antibiotic treatment were given it; others were advised about symptom relief and were followed up as necessary.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

Whether patients returned to the clinic, and whether antibiotics were subsequently prescribed.
RESULTS:

Two patients were prescribed antibiotics at the first visit. Of the remaining 98 people, only four returned to the clinic because of earache, and two of these were prescribed antibiotics. Thus, of 100 people with earache, four received antibiotic prescriptions.
CONCLUSIONS:

Most people who present to primary care physicians with earache do not need antibiotics for what appears to be a mostly self-limiting condition. Both physicians and patients should be educated about this.",PubMedAbstracts
"BACKGROUND:

Information on patient symptoms can be obtained by patient self-report or medical records review. Both methods have limitations.
AIMS:

To assess the agreement between self-report and documentation in the medical records of signs/symptoms of respiratory illness (fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, earache, and chills).
METHODS:

Respondents were 176 research participants in the Hutterite Influenza Prevention Study during the 2008-2009 influenza season with information about the presence or absence of signs/symptoms from both self-report and primary care medical records.
RESULTS:

Compared with medical records, lower proportions of self-reported fever, sore throat, earache, cough, and sinus problems were found. Total agreements between self-report and medical report of symptoms ranged from 61% (for sore throat) to 88% (for muscle aches and earache), with kappa estimates varying from 0.05 (for chills) to 0.41 (for cough) and 0.51 (for earache). Negative agreement was considerably higher (from 68% for sore throat to 93% for muscle aches and earache) than positive agreement (from 13% for chills to 58% for earache) for each symptom except cough where positive agreement (77%) was higher than negative agreement (64%). Agreements varied by age group. We found better agreement for earache (kappa = 0.62) and lower agreements for headache, sinus problems, muscle aches, fatigue, and chills in older children (aged >5 years) and adults.
CONCLUSIONS:

Agreements were variable depending on the specific symptom. Contrary to research in other patient populations which suggests that clinicians report fewer symptoms than patients, we found that the medical record captured more symptoms than selfreport. Symptom agreement and disagreement may be affected by the perspectives of the person experiencing them, the observer, the symptoms themselves, measurement error, the setting in which the symptoms were observed and recorded, and the broader community and cultural context of patients.",PubMedAbstracts
"Many patients in primary care present with ear pain (otalgia). When the ear is the source of the pain (primary otalgia), the ear examination is usually abnormal. When the ear is not the source of the pain (secondary otalgia), the ear examination is typically normal. The cause of primary otalgia is usually apparent on examination; the most common causes are otitis media and otitis externa. The cause of secondary otalgia is often difficult to determine because the innervation of the ear is complex and there are many potential sources of referred pain. The most common causes are temporomandibular joint syndrome, pharyngitis, dental disease, and cervical spine arthritis. If the diagnosis is not clear from the history and physical examination, options include a trial of symptomatic treatment without a clear diagnosis; imaging studies; and consultation with an otolaryngologist. Patients who smoke, drink alcohol, are older than 50 years, or have diabetes are at higher risk of a cause of ear pain that needs further evaluation. Patients whose history or physical examination increases suspicion for a serious occult cause of ear pain or whose symptoms persist after symptomatic treatment should be considered for further evaluation, such as magnetic resonance imaging, fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy, or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate measurement.",PubMedAbstracts
"Many patients who present with otalgia have a normal otological examination, and a distant source of pain must be considered. The ear receives an extensive sensory innervation arising from six nerve roots. Many other structures in the head, neck and thorax share a common neuronal pathway with the ear, and these tissues represent the possible sites of disease in the cases of referred otalgia. Consequently, the differential diagnosis is extensive and varied. Making an accurate diagnosis relies on an understanding of the complex distribution of nerve fibres and a structured approach to patient assessment. This article aims to classify the aetiology of referred otalgia and to outline current treatments for these conditions. The origins of referred otalgia may be as remote as the cranial cavity and thorax; however, dental disease, tonsillitis, temporomandibular joint disorders and cervical spine pathology represent the most frequent causes. Ear pain may also be the first sign of a head and neck malignancy. Patients complaining of otalgia, with risk factors for an aerodigestive neoplasm, and a normal ENT examination require an urgent otolaryngological opinion.",PubMedAbstracts
"The patient presenting with otalgia poses a diagnostic challenge for which orderly and diligent evaluation and management is needed. The etiology of otalgia can be either primary or referred, and a detailed history and physical examination with directed studies as indicated can elucidate the cause of the pain.",PubMedAbstracts
"The importance of the cervical spine in routine ENT practice is discussed, using the example of otalgia due to disorders of the cervical vertebra: Evaluation and follow-ups of 13,000 patients showed that 6% had diseases caused by the cervical spine. Frequency, pathophysiology and treatment results of cervicogenic otalgia are presented. The principles of adequate functional diagnostics and therapy of cervical spine disorders are explained.",PubMedAbstracts
"BACKGROUND:

Otalgia is a common presenting symptom to the ENT clinic. The aetiology of otalgia can be divided into otological and referred depending on its underlying pathology. This article aims to provide a systematic and evidence-based method of managing a patient with referred otalgia.
METHODS:

The data in this article are based on a literature review performed on MEDLINE and EMBASE in January 2010. The keywords used included otalgia in combination with diagnosis, management, investigations and treatment. Articles in the English language were selected and reviewed. Suitable references from these articles were also reviewed.
RESULTS:

The majority of published literature on the management of diseases causing referred otalgia is level III/IV evidence.
CONCLUSIONS:

An understanding of the different causes of referred otalgia is essential as it can be multifactorial in origin. The main concern in a patient with referred otalgia is overlooking a malignant lesion in the upper aerodigestive tract or base of skull/infratemporal fossae. A thorough history followed by a systematic examination usually helps to arrive at a diagnosis. Treatment should be directed towards the underlying pathology.",PubMedAbstracts
