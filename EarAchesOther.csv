"crazy unknown pain HELP!

Last week I was taking a shortcut home and walked inbetween two loud speakers and they both went off with this super loud awful music point blank nunknown my unknowns. I quickly ran away from the noise and continued walking home noticing my unknowns felt hot and sore. Fast forward a week later at the ENT and now I have hot achey unknown pain and tinnitus but the hunknowning test shows no hunknowning loss so that's a relief! However the ENT told me that something called TRT will help my unknown pain and I hope to God she's right. Over all I'm really freeakin scared about what's going on and how noise feels painful like hot pitchforks in my freakin unknown!",earAche,Reddit
"No, TRT is tinnitus retraining therapy. It is a therapy and not a treatment. TRT will teach you how to handle the stress of T but is also useful for hypercausia.
For now, you need to avoid noise for a long time. Als adapt your food eg. no coffee, no chocolate, no alcohol etc.
The burning feeling will get better but you need to avoid noise now. Use unknownplugs outside/work.",earAche,Reddit
"unknown pain that gets worse when turning head

21M. I have a son in my right unknown and it feels like it is blocked. Inside my unknown feels numb but painful to touch, especially around the tragus and pushing up on the area behind the lobe. The pain is worse when I turn my head so my unknown is down and better when it?s up.",earAche,Reddit
"Possible cause of unknown pain

So I got the sony xm3s and have been using it for a week or two. However i noticed that my right inner unknown started to hurt whenever I try to pop it or if I stick my finger in and curl it so it makes that pop sound (if that makes sense). Could this be the anc within the headphones? That was my guess but my left unknown doesnt experience these symptoms. My other guess is that i sleep on my right unknown alot so something mightve went wrong. Is it the headphones?",earAche,Reddit
"ANC does not cause unknown stress. There's a semi pervasive myth that the noise cancellation mechanism causes double the stress on the unknown drum compared to non-ANC, but this is incorrect. If it's related to the headphone (and remember, correlation does not necessarily imply causation) it's most likely that you simply listened too loud, too long.",earAche,Reddit
"I read somewhere that ANC can cause psychosomatic symptoms in some people. The unnatural lack of noise causes a feeling that the unknowndrum is being sucked outwards, like when taking a fast elevator down. I got that in the first day of using the WH-XM3 with full noise canceling but it went away quickly.",earAche,Reddit
Im using the WF-XM3 with ANC almost always enabled and dont feel any pressure whatsoever,earAche,Reddit
"This is going to be a slightly winded discussion, But currently I am dealing with unknown pain/aches and referred headaches/neckaches. It started last Friday with a boil in my unknown, I mistakenly tried to pop it on Saturday and was irritated for a bit. Monday morning I had bad chills and felt very cold, I had a temperature of 100.8F which I went to an Urgent Care center where they looked in my unknown and didn't see much and diagnosed me with a viral flu like illness. The fever broke that day and haven't had a fever since.


However, Yesterday Morning my unknown was completely swollen and felt like oozing, but never saw anything come out. I went back to the Urgent care center where the doctor checked my vitals and lymph nodes but nothing out of the ordinary in that regard, he checked my unknowns and saw the inflammation on my unknown drum and then prescribed me with unknowndrops along with Oral antibiotics, Its day 2 now and am rather curious of how long it should take to get back to normal?


I think I am feeling better but my unknown is still hurting and the referred pain from it is bugging me badly. I can bend my neck fine with no issues or pain, the Mastoid is not tender to the touch, its just slight neck pain/nunknown unknown and headache, most is calmed down by Ibuprofen but is always kinda there. Will this go away with the unknown infection and is this unknown infection being treated correctly?",earAche,Reddit
"unknown pain, can't figure out how to make it comfortable.
Issue

I've been trying to look through this sub and figure out how to make these things comfortable in the unknown and I've had no luck. I've literally done everything, every combination of tips and wings, I used my AKG tips, Nothing still pain.

Iv used buds my entire life and never had an issue but these feel like something is jamming into my unknown constantly and then the pain goes away and when I take it out I have the worst unknown ache for an hour or so. I love these so much, I just wish they made them more comfortable cause this really sucks and makes me sad thinking I might actually have to return them.

Can someone help me that has figured out how to make them comfortable? Thanks in advance !",earAche,Reddit
"i used to have the same problem. first when i got the buds they were comfy then a few weeks ago i had this terrible unknown fatigue from wunknowning them especially the unknown wings, couldnt have them on for 30 minutes due to the pain. Now they feel super comfy, even though they have the same size unknown tips and wings. i dont understand it myself but they got comfy with time lol

I had a time where the area by the charge contact points would create a pressure point on my unknown, causing said unknownache. Eventually, it went away over time, but its probably my unknown conforming to the buds, I can't think of any other reason.

If you can't stand it try not pushing them into your unknown so hard, instead pull them out just a tad and keep them secure by twisting the top back so the fin engages more with your unknown. I found that helps the most",earAche,Reddit
"Can impacted wisdom teeth cause unknown or naw pain/issues?
Question(s)

I?m 24. I still have my wisdom teeth. I haven?t been to the dentist in yunknowns (no dental insurance). I know I have impacted wisdom teeth because I can see them when I open my mouth and how squished they look way in the back. They never fully grew in because there?s not enough room. Just my wisdom teeth alone can hurt or feel uncomfortable at times. My bottom teeth have become more crooked over the last couple yunknowns as well - I?m assuming because there?s not enough space in my mouth and the wisdom teeth are pushing them closer together.

Anyways, I?ve noticed more crackling and popping in my jaw the last yunknown or so. It doesn?t always bother me just sort of an annoyance when I hunknown it. Today, however, I woke up with pretty horrible pain in my jaw - especially the left side. I found it painful to eat, yawn, or talk. I took some ibuprofen and continued on with my day.

I also grind/clench my teeth when I sleep. I?ll sometimes wake up in the night or morning and feel myself clenching my teeth so hard. So, that could be an issue in itself.

But, today?s pain is the worst jaw pain I?ve ever had. Like I said, I usually don?t get the pain just the popping. I can feel the soreness close to my unknown as well. The right side doesn?t feel nunknownly as sore as the left side.",tmj,Reddit
"This is normal for people with unknown issues. I suggest that since you said you clench at night you need a mouth guard or stress reduction. I suggest a standard mouth guard you can get from walmart temporarily until you can get a custom one. There are cheaper options I hunknown other than a dentist. Apparently where you get the guard from, they send a mould and then send a guard back. I think its Amazon? Or something like that online.

My wisdom teeth are coming in too but they aren't causing unknown because unknown is an issue with the joint itself. I notice when I use a mouth guard, that tense feeling releases in the back of my mouth right below the unknown. I hope this helps! If you go to a unknown website theres info on what home remedies to use. I suggest trying all of them until your jaw joint can heal. I'm aiming for 2 weeks of home therapy.
level 1

The teeth determine the forces on the jaw whenever you bite. if they're not even and balanced you can get all kinds of problems. Have you seen an orthodontist?",tmj,Reddit
"I have unknown which I've been dealing with for several yunknowns, I clench my teeth at night and I wunknown a special night guard because of it. Prior to starting effexor my unknown pain subsided significantly, going from a 6 to around a 2. I'm on my third week of 75mg effexor and the passed couple of days my jaw pain has reverted back to it's original pain level. I googled and there are some posts talking about how Effexor was causing people to clench at night, and causing jaw pain. (something I've dealt with before effexor.) I'm trying to understand if I am just having a flare up or if my recent jaw pain is from being on Effexor, it's hard to say. Does anyone else have any experiences with clenching or jaw pain while on Effexor or know any useful information regarding this?",tmj,Reddit
"I started clenching when my dose was increased from 150 to 300 mg. I chew on my cheeks but have no other experience with clenching or grinding.
level 1

i?m almost 22 and ive had unknown most of my memorable life. when i first started effexor at 75mg it was really bad and my jaw was always sore and clenched. thankfully for me it went away as my body adjusted!


How long did it take before the clenching side-effects stopped? Did it just go back to your regular pain level?
level 3

My unknown wasn?t severe, even before Effexor. If i eat a bagel I?ll be sore from the audibly uncomfortable popping, but I never had too much of an issue with clenching. For me the severe clenching went away within a week, but there are certain days where I find myself clenching, and I?ll be sore the next day. That never happened with me before Effexor!",tmj,Reddit
"Can unknown cause neck pain?
Question(s)

I suddenly developed TMD 4-6 yunknowns ago. My jaw suddenly locked and since then I have been experiencing the constant clicking noises. During stress my jaw would get locked and I had problem even eating. A few days ago I started having neck pain on my left side. TMD had only affected my right jaw. So my left jaw was completely fine. After developing neck pain by night my left jaw had the pain characteristic to TMD. I don't know if this neck pain is related. Additional information-

    My upper teeth are way ahead of my lower teeth. I needed braces to correct it but that would have required teeth being pulled out as there was no space. Because of this I never got braces.
