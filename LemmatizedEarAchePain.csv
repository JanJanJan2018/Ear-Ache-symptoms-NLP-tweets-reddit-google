"Introduction? a earache ( otalgia or ear pain ) be pain in one or both ear that may last a short or long time. Earache be prevalent in the population with temporomandibular joint disorder ( TMJDs ), but there be a dearth of epidemiologic study regard the association between TMJD and ear pain and ear fullness in old people. Objective? To assess the presence of earache and ear fullness in elderly patient with TMJD. method? A cross - sectional study be conduct in independently live, elderly individual. TMJD be assess by dental evaluation and earache be verify by medical history. Statistical analysis be perform use the chi - square test and relative risk. result? Of the 197 subject evaluate in this part of the study, 22 have earache, and 35 be verify by ear fullness. Of the 22 subject with earache, none have conductive or mix hear loss in the ear test. There be a significant association ( p? =? 0. 036 ) between the TMJD and earache ( odd ratio? =? 2. 3 ), but there be no significant association between the TMJD and ear fullness. Conclusion? this result highlight the importance of identify risk factor for earache that can be modify through specific intervention, which be essential in the prevention of future episode, as good as manage the process of treatment of elderly patient in general","Introduction?An earache (otalgia or ear pain) is pain in one or both ears that may last a short or long time.

"Otalgia be a common symptom in general practice and represent the sensation of pain in the ear.

In many case it be difficult to identify the underlay disease of refer otalgia. It may be the first symptom of a head - and - neck carcinoma. In case of otalgia with normal otologic finding, the differential diagnostic process must be specifically direct to the common sensory innervation of the ear and the head - and - neck structure.

"BACKGROUND: Information on patient symptom can be obtain by patient self - report or medical record review. Both method have limitation. aim: To assess the agreement between self - report and documentation in the medical record of sign / symptom of respiratory illness ( fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, sinus problem, muscle ache, fatigue, earache, and chill ). method: respondent be 176 research participant in the Hutterite Influenza Prevention Study during the 2008 - 2009 influenza season with information about the presence or absence of sign / symptom from both self - report and primary care medical record. result: compare with medical record, low proportion of self - report fever, sore throat, earache, cough, and sinus problem be find. Total agreement between self - report and medical report of symptom range from 61 % ( for sore throat ) to 88 % ( for muscle ache and earache ), with kappa estimate vary from 0.05 ( for chill ) to 0.41 ( for cough ) and 0.51 ( for earache ). Negative agreement be considerably high ( from 68 % for sore throat to 93 % for muscle ache and earache ) than positive agreement ( from 13 % for chill to 58 % for earache ) for each symptom except cough where positive agreement ( 77 % ) be high than negative agreement ( 64 % ). agreement vary by age group.
